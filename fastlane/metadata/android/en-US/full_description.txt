Acastus-Photon translates name of street/city/point-of-interest to geo-coordinate which can be:

* opened in a map or navigation app such as OsmAnd, Maps.me, APhotoManager.
* shared with other people via the send command.

The Photon-Server-Software which Acastus-Photon calls over the internet is a replacement for Google Maps and other geocoding services that you can run on your own server.
