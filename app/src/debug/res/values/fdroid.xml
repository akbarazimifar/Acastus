Acastus-Photon translates name of street/city/point-of-interest
to geo-coordinate which can be

You can start Acastus by clicking on an adresss in the Android Contacts app (SimpleContatcs).

The Photon-Server-Software which Acastus-Photon calls over the internet
is a replacement for Google Maps and other geocoding services that you
can run on your own server.
