Acastus Photon is a completely private, free and open source Address / POI lookup application for android.

Use it to find nearby places, all without the privacy invasions and tracking features of other 
apps. 

Share your location to other people, knowing full well that the information is kept private.

Acastus Photon relies on [Photon](http://photon.komoot.io/api) as the backend, a replacement for Google Maps and other geocoding services
that you can run on your own server. It uses the photon-api to fetch results to your phone, allowing
you to search for places, then open and navigate to the result in your preferred 
navigation app such as OsmAnd or Maps.me.

Details on setting up your own Photon instance are here: https://github.com/komoot/photon

[Acastus](https://github.com/DanielBarnett714/Acastus) has been originally created by DanielBarnett714 and used [Pelias](https://pelias.io) / Mapzen backend. This fork is maintained by k3b and [GDR!](https://gdr.name/) and uses Photon backend hosted by [Komoot](https://komoot.de/). You can use your own backend in settings. The fork exists because Mapzen went bankrupt and there don't seem to be any other public Pelias instances. Also, Photon seems to do a better job at free text searches.

Acastus is the son of Pelias in Greek mythology and using this name for my fork doesn't make sense, but who cares.
